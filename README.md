# library
Will be creating a Library app, that stores book data into a class (title, author, # of pages, read/not read) with the option to add and remove books. This data will not be stored in a backend server. However, I will come back to the project to add a login, and backend to store the data inside a cloud/server sometime in the future.


# Post Completion
Created the library app using local storage. All data is stored in an array, and removed (from screen and array) user selected book (onlcick with trashcan image).
